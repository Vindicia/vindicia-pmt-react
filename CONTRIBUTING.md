# Contributing to `vindicia-pmt-react`

First off, thank you for considering contributing to `vindicia-pmt-react`. As time passes and vindicia.js is updated, this library is bound to need to be adjusted.

## Issues

`vindicia-pmt-react` is a React wrapper for `vindicia.js`. Please limit new issues to those which are directly from this wrapper and not `vindicia.js`.

If you have found a bug, please [let us know](https://github.com/Vindicia/vindicia-pmt-react/issues/new)!

## How you can help

So you want to help? Great! Here are a few ways you can help:

- Extending / Maintaining Functionality
  - As `vindicia.js` is under active development, it may be changed at any time. These changes may or may not match up with the functionality provided by the `vindicia-pmt-react` component.
- Furthering Documentation
  - See something in the README that could be explained more clearly? Feel free to make a suggestion. 
- Extending Demo Examples
  - Is there some functionality you wish the demo would illustrate? Adding to the demo can improve your understanding of the component as well as be more welcoming to newcomers.

## Developing

If you have found something you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to open a pull request. All pull requests will be reviewed by someone at Vindicia before being merged.

Be sure you check your code first with the following commands:

- ESLint for proper formatting and syntax checking:
  - `yarn run lint`
- Jest for running our existing test suite
  - `yarn test`
